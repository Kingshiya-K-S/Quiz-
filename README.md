# Quiz-

Developed a fully functional, terminal-based Multiple-Choice Quiz Application using Python 3 in a Jupyter Notebook environment, focusing on user interaction, input validation, and dynamic score computation.
Designed and implemented a data-driven question bank using a list of dictionaries to store 25 general knowledge questions with structured key-value pairs for questions, options, and correct answers.
Developed a modular architecture with reusable functions for question rendering (ask_question) and quiz execution (run_quiz) to enhance code readability and scalability.
Implemented robust user input validation logic to accept only valid options (Aâ€“D), using conditional loops to handle incorrect inputs gracefully.
Integrated real-time feedback mechanisms and logic to track user performance using counters and conditional branching.
Added dynamic performance evaluation at the end of the quiz, providing personalized feedback messages based on total score.
Employed Python constructs such as for loops, conditionals, user-defined functions, and list/dictionary manipulations to maintain clean and efficient code structure.
